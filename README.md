# retrojam-2017

Our 2<sup>nd</sup> place entry for IEEE & Porto Graphics' 2017 RETRO JAM was **'BOB'**, a game entirely developed for the **PICO-8 fantasy console** by a team of five FEUP computer engineering students.  
See every entry over [here](https://github.com/AJRamos308/RetroJam-Submissions).

## Concept
You play as a forgetful family man who must **desperately** get to work or else he's fired.  
Frantically **dash through every room**, grabbing your suit, car keys and more along the way, before driving to your workplace!  

The obligatory theme was **DISCOVERY**. With such a broad topic we preferred to separate ourselves from maybe the more direct space exploration, tomb raiding experiences and apply the 'finding' aspect to a more **unusual theme**.

## Thoughts
It was damn awesome sharing some thoughts with you all - everyone was super nice!  
Hopefully my sentences made sense even though I was sleep deprived and very poorly caffeinated.  
**See you all at the next one!** :heart:
